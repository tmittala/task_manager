# Tushar's Task Manager / To-Do List

This is a simple task manager application created by me. The application allows users to manage their tasks by adding, editing, and deleting them.

## Usage

To use the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tmittala/task_manager.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd task_manager
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:5000` to use the application.

## Demo
